  <p>For this bi-weekly paper review, my choice fell upon a paper that I&rsquo;ve skimmed
through multiple times before, but never gave the proper read-through it
deserves. It was a definite given when I started to curate a list of papers that
I wanted to include in this series of reviews. Not only do I find it to be an
elegant and well-composed paper, but it has had nothing but an /imperative/ influence
on the RNA-seq based analysis these last years. In the paper, they present a model for
normalization (and variance stabilization) of single-cell RNA-seq
data, which now has become widely adopted within the community. Almost every paper not
focusing on method development that I&rsquo;ve stumbled across, use the
&ldquo;<em>sctransform</em>&rdquo; package or derivatives of it to normalize scRNA-seq data. Thus,
without further ado let us begin.</p>

<p><strong>Paper Title :</strong> <em>Normalization and variance stabilization of single-cell RNA-seq data using regularized negative binomial regression</em></p>
<p><strong>Authors :</strong> Christoph Hafemeister and Rahul Satija</p>
<p><strong>Published</strong> 23 December 2019</p>
<p><strong>doi :</strong> <a href="https://doi.org/10.1186/s13059-019-1874-1">https://doi.org/10.1186/s13059-019-1874-1</a></p>
<p><strong>Review :</strong> Anyone who has ever worked with single cell RNA-seq data knows that
before any &ldquo;flashy and cool&rdquo; results can be extracted, we need to apply some
pre-processing steps to our data. Aside from filtering for low quality
observations or irrelevant features, the very first step - and perhaps most
important - tends to be <strong>normalization</strong> of the data. Normalization is a dead
given in any analysis workflow, but let us just take one step back and ask why?
Why do we care about normalization, why can&rsquo;t we just &ldquo;jump right at it&rdquo;?</p>
<p>Probing our data with the right tools will allow us to identify cell types and
cell states as well as cell-to-cell variations. However if we aren&rsquo;t careful <em>technical
factors</em> might confound these results, making us come to incorrect and false
conclusions regarding the patterns in our data. One technical factor that has a
huge influence on the result of our downstream analysis is the <em>sequencing
depth</em>. For example, imagine that we have two cell types <em>A</em> and <em>B</em>, where
cells of <em>A</em> in general have higher transcriptional activity than those of <em>B</em>.
Now if we were to compare the (raw and unprocessed) expression of a houskeeping
gene between cells from the two types, it would be listed as upregulated
in <em>A</em>, even though we expect all housekeeping genes to be of approximately equal relative
expression across cell types. This is of course undesireable, and we
therefore attempt to normalize the data, in order to remove any technical variation
while preferably maintaining biological differences.</p>
<p>The authors define two &ldquo;objectives&rdquo; or criteria, that should hold for a
single-cell data set to be considered sucessfully normalized:</p>
<ol>
<li>Normalized expression should be uncorrelated with sequencing depth of cells.</li>
<li>Variance of a normalized gene (across cells) should not be affected by gene
abundance or sequencing depth.</li>
</ol>
<p>In contrast to the two previously existing paradigms of using either
cell-specific scaling factors or probabilistic approaches they consider their
approach as more of a <em>statistical</em> approach, distinct from the others. I would
perhaps say that their strategy could fit into to the set of probabilistic approaches,
but that&rsquo;s a minor detail.</p>
<p>The method they present builds on a generalized linear model (GLM) where they
use a <em>constrained negative binomial</em> error model, with sequencing depth as a
covariate, and a log-link function for the mean.</p>
<p>After evaluating different error models such
as: an unconstrained Poisson, a Negative Binomial and a Zero Inflated Negative
Binomial (ZINB), they noticed that the Poisson was not flexible enough, while the
unconstrained NB and ZINB models were prone to overfitting. Therefore, as
is common in several bulk normalization methods, they decided to regularize
the model parameters by <em>pooling information</em> from genes with similar mean
expression values, resulting in a <strong>regularized negative binomial regression</strong>.
The constrained part is one of the model&rsquo;s key features, the other one being to
include the sequencing depth as a covariate. We will soon come back to the
regularization, but let us first just briefly look at their GLM model:</p>
$$ \log(E[x_{gc}]) = \log(\mu_{gc}) = \beta_{0g} + \beta_{1g} \log_{ 10 }(m_c) $$<p>Where $x_{gc}$ is the expression of gene $g$ in cell $c$, and $m_{c}$ is the
library size used as a proxy for sequencing depth.</p>
<p>In short, this means that the authors make the implicit assumption that <strong>most
genes are not differentially expressed</strong>; genes have a common baseline
($\beta_{0g}$) and differences across cells will mainly be due to their varying
library size (influence controlled by $\beta_{1g}$).</p>
<p>The negative binomial has one more parameter that we need to pay attention to,
the dispersion parameter $\theta$ which gives us the variance of our data. That
is, if:</p>
$$ x \sim NB(\mu,\theta)$$<p>then</p>
$$E[x] = \mu, \quad Var[x] = \mu + \frac{\mu^2}{\theta}$$<p>Interestingly, the authors convincingly show that if we were to learn one set of
parameters for each gene, these will be severely overfitted. What really made me
appreciate the prevalance of this overfitting, was the results they present in
Figure 2 (included below).</p>
<p><img src="./imgs/figure2.png" alt="figure2"></p>
<p>In the top row they show the estimated parameter values plotted as a function of
gene mean; in a good model we would expect to have similar parameter values for
genes with similar mean values. In the bottom row, they fit their GLM model to a
random subsets of the data and assessed the variance of the parameter values (in
a bootstrap fashion), showing how the variance (red dots) was very high, especially for
low and medium expressed genes.</p>
<p>To remedy this issue of overfitting, they <em>regularize</em> their model, though not
using the regularization terms that perhaps most of our familiar with like a
$l_1$ or $l_2$ penalty. Instead they pool information from several genes to make
more robust estimates. They first fit one GLM to each gene, <strong>but</strong> then proceed to
apply kernel regression to the resulting parameter estimates. The intent being
to learn regularized parameters that depend on a gene&rsquo;s average expression. The
blue dots in panel B of the figure above show the variance after using this
regularized approach; as you can see the variance in parameter estimates is
significantly reduced.</p>
<p>Though, we still have some work left to do before our data is normalized. Having
obtained the set of regularized parameters, one applies this regression model to
the data in order to compute the residuals ($r_{gc}$).</p>
$$ r_{gc} = x_{gc} - \mu_{gc}, \quad \mu_{gc} = \exp[\beta_{0g}+ \beta_{1g}\log_{10}(m_c)] $$<p>The residuals represent the difference between the response
estimated mean and the observed expression value. But as one might remember, for the
negative binomial, the variance can differ between genes even though they have
the same mean ($\mu$), an effect of the dispersion parameter $\theta$. Thus, we will
not use the <em>raw</em> residuals, but what is known as the <em>Pearson residuals</em> ($z_{gc}$),
which account for the gene-specific variation term:</p>
$$ z_{gc} = \frac{r_{gc}}{\sigma_{gc}}, \quad \sigma_{gc} = \sqrt{\mu_{gc} +
\frac{\mu_{gc}^2}{\theta_g}} $$<p>This transformation presents the residuals in units of standard deviations,
correcting for the specific gene variance. Implementationwise they also clip
their $z_{gc}$ values to be less than $\sqrt{N}$ (where $N = $ number of cells),
in order to &ldquo;reduce the impact of extreme outliers&rdquo;. This value seems to have
been determined fairly empirically.</p>
<p>The Pearson residuals are <strong>treated as normalized expression levels</strong>;
the idea being that we&rsquo;ve now regressed out any contribution from the sequencing
depth to the observed expression levels. Using Pearson residuals has one
additional benefit, being that the transformation we apply to compute them is inherently
<em>variance-stabilizing</em>.</p>
<p>The image below is a merge between Figure 1C-E and Figure 3A-B and requires a
bit of explanation in order to make sense. The curves represent the expression
values as a function of cell UMI count where the genes have been divided into
six groups based on their average expression in the data set. The six groups are
not equally sized, but represent bins with equal width spanning the expression
range. The bottom bar graphs are slightly more complex; the same six gene groups
are used, and the cells are divided into five equally-sized groups with
increasing average sequencing depth (group 1 having the highest value). Next,
they calculated the total variance in each gene to then see how much each cell
group contributed to this value. In perfectly normalized data, one would expect
to see an equal contribution (here $20\\%$) between the cell groups, as gene
expression should be uncorrelated with sequencing depth (criterion 1 from their
&ldquo;objectives&rdquo;).</p>
<p><img src="./imgs/res.png" alt="compilation"></p>
<p>Comparing the use of Pearson residuals with raw UMI counts and
log-normaliztion, we observe the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Using raw UMI counts, a clear correlation between sequencing depth and gene
expression in all ranges of gene expression is present. Log-normalization
mitigate this issue among lowly expressed genes (group 4-5), but it persists
in the high and medium expressed genes. The regularized negative binomial
normalization renders values near completely independent (a horizontal line)
of the sequencing depth, only very highly expressed genes still show some
dependence; the authors claim that this is likely due to very few genes of
such expression being present in the data and the regularization process thus
becomes less robust.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There&rsquo;s an unequal variance contribution in the two alternative approaches.
One example that the authors highlight is how cells with low UMI counts have a
<em>disproportional influence</em> on the variance among high-abundance genes in the log-normalization
method. Something that might dampen the contribution from other gene groups.
In the regularization based method, we see a very - almost surprisingly -
homogeneous distribution of the variance.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The authors also, which I appreciate, show how the normalization can impact the
downstream results as well. The most striking example - in my opinion - is when
they compare outcomes of a DE (Differential Expression) analysis. They construct
a simple but clever experiment, where they first grabbed all CD14+ monocytes (5551
cells) from the PBMC data set they use throughout the paper. They then split
this set into two equally-sized (and mutually exhaustive) subsets, followed by
downsampling of the UMIs in <em>one of the subsets</em>, giving them $50\\%$ of their
original UMI counts but with the same distribution as before across the genes. They then
subjected the two groups to a <em>t</em>-test in order to find DE genes. Obviously,
since these are cells from the same population, we expect zero DE genes if our
data is properly normalized. As you can see in the figure below (modified Figure
6E), this was not quite the case for the log-normalized data:</p>
<p><img src="./imgs/de.png" alt="de-genes"></p>
<p>Rather than finding zero DE genes, using log-normalization gave us $2331$ of them. The
regularized negative binomial regression wasn&rsquo;t perfect either, but it gave us
$11$ false positives, about $0.5\\%$ of $2331$. The authors also point out that
these $11$ genes are all highly expressed genes, where we know the
regularization process had some issues. They also looked into masking of true DE
genes between populations of different sequencing depths and showed how
log-normalization can give some weird results in these cases (incorrect
assignment of DE genes) while their approach seemed to give the expected
results.</p>
<p>The paper contains some other interesting results, but what I&rsquo;ve presented above
captures the &ldquo;geist&rdquo; of their method and is - at least to me - convincing
enough. Thus, I&rsquo;d like to focus a bit on their implementation.</p>
<p>First I should say that the claim (in the abstract) that their procedure &ldquo;<em>omits
the need for heuristic steps including psedocount addition or
log-transformation</em>&rdquo;, might be a bit of a stretch. Indeed, they don&rsquo;t use a
pseudocount in a log-transformation, but they use a variant of the geometric
mean (more robust than the arithmetic mean to outliers) when computing gene
average expression:</p>
$$\exp(\frac{1}{|C|}\sum_{c\in C} \log(x_{gc}+\varepsilon)) - \varepsilon $$<p>where $\varepsilon$ is &ldquo;<em>a small fixed value to avoid $\\:\log(0)$</em>&rdquo;, which they set
to $\varepsilon = 1$ after trying several values in the range $[0.0001,1]$. In
my ears this sounds an awful lot like a pseudocount, but again, minor detail.</p>
<p>The most time-consuming step, as expected, is to fit a GLM to each gene (before
the kernel regression). As the whole idea with the smoothing is to learn a
<em>mapping between average expression and parameter value</em>, they reason that it
should be sufficient to use a subset of the genes for this procedure (I agree). To
properly sample the range of gene means they discard uniform sampling in favor
of a categorical sampling with each gene&rsquo;s probability of being sampled defined
as:</p>
$$ p_g \propto \frac{1}{\log_{10}(\bar{x}_g)}$$<p>Where $\bar{x}_{g}$ is gene $g$&rsquo;s average expression. Assessing different
values, they noted that using a subset of $\sim2000$ genes gave near identical
results to the full gene set, hence this is set to the default value.</p>
<p>They also evaluated different approaches to estimate the gene specific
parameters, and settled on a choice where they: assume a Poisson error
distribution to estimate $(\beta_{0g},\beta_{1g})$, from which they can compute
the mean $\mu_g$. The mean is then kept fixed in order to estimate $\theta_g$
using maximum likelihood. This is, due to the Poisson being a univariate
distribution, much faster than using a two parameter NB error model in the GLM.</p>
<p>They also mention how their normalization approach can be extended to include
other covariates than sequencing depth. When using these other covariates, two
rounds of regression will be performed: one where they only use sequencing
depth as a covariate, followed by one round where they inlcude all covariates
but keep the sequencing depth parameters fixed. This is because the other
covariates can&rsquo;t be expected to share information across genes, hence no
regularization can be performed with them.</p>
<p>To summarize, this paper presents a fast and interpretable way of normalizing
data that is built on a statistical framework using a regularized negative
binomial GLM. They convincingly show how raw UMI and log-normalization is
confounded by sequencing depth, as well as our need to regularize the fitted
models to get robust parameter estimates. I truly enjoyed reading this work, it&rsquo;s
clearly and concise with good experiments to back-up their claims.</p>
