      <title>Automated Tracking of Cells</title>
      <link>/post/2021-01-08-celltracker/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve always found it appealing, or rather &lt;em&gt;enticing&lt;/em&gt;, to study biological
systems from a more formal and mathematical perspective; with the main objective
to somehow be able to describe them with equations rather than words. Equations
are exact, definite, universal, but foremost, they are &lt;em&gt;predictive&lt;/em&gt;. The
alluring property of mathematical models is that they do not only provide a
description of our system, but they are also responsive, we may ask &lt;em&gt;&amp;ldquo;if I
replace parameter X with parameter Y, what will my system look like?&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, our models - however beautiful or carefully constructed - are nothing
but just that, models. And as the well known apohorism states, &lt;em&gt;&amp;ldquo;all models
are wrong&amp;rdquo;&lt;/em&gt;. While this statement is true, it is far from detrimental.
Sometimes, being wrong but within a certain marginal of error to the truth is
just about good enough. When driving, none of us knows the exact distance to the
other cars, or how much a push on the gas will accelerate our car, still (most
of the time) we manage to zig-zag through the densely packed lanes without
crashing into each other - all from the simple &lt;em&gt;incorrect&lt;/em&gt; model we constructed
in our minds. So, yes - models are wrong, but they are most certainly useful and
tremendously valuable in our quest to understand and analyze biological systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was with this interest - and a requirement for PhD students at KTH to collect
60 ECTS credits - that I enrolled for a course in Applied Estimation. In short,
the course focus on how to estimate states or parameters from noisy measurements
such as empirical data. Albeit designed for people working with robotics, the
concepts are indubitably applicable to biology - where noise is the rule
rather than the exception.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;anim.gif&#34; alt=&#34;tracking animation&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a part of the course, we had to devise our own project (where one estimation
method was to used) and implement it in code. My choice fell upon a subject (and
method) that I have little previous experience with: automated &lt;em&gt;cell tracking&lt;/em&gt;
in brightfield images, using GM-PHD (Gaussian Mixture Probability Hypothesis
Density) filters. The theory is very interesting, and I was particularly
intrigued by the concept of &lt;em&gt;Random Finite Sets&lt;/em&gt;, here used to track multiple
objects simultaneously. The method shares many similarities with the Kalman
Filter, but rather than propagating a single state, the whole set is propagated
in time. Easily explained, one might think of it as propagating a Gaussian
Mixture in time, where each component represents a peak or cell. The &lt;a href=&#34;https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1710358&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;original
publication&lt;/a&gt; by Vo and Ma outlines
the details of the GM-PHD filter better than I could ever attempt to, and I
would refer anyone with an interest to have a close look at it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As for the final product, I implemented the algorithm proposed by Vo and Ma
(Table I-III) in python, with an easy to use CLI; allowing anyone who might want
to try it out to do so fairly (I hope) seamlessly. Instructions and examples of
usage can be found at the &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/almaan/CellTracker&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;github&lt;/a&gt; page.
The animated image above is the result of applying this implementation to a set
of &amp;ldquo;&lt;em&gt;HeLa cells stably expressing H2b-GFP&lt;/em&gt;&amp;rdquo;, downloaded from
&lt;a href=&#34;http://celltrackingchallenge.net/2d-datasets/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;celltrackingchallenge.net&lt;/a&gt;. The
implementation is far from perfect, and much work remains to even have a chance
of competing with the more sophisticated alternatives. Still, for a couple of
days of work, the performance is not too bad - and it was a fun experience
implementing it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The course has prompted a lot of new ideas and really allowed me to see some old
problems from a completely different lens. For example, I believe a lot of the
ideas found in SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping) could be used when
working with questions related to trajectory inferenc, where we partly want to
assess the developmental landscape but also map a path through it. It&amp;rsquo;s always a
very rewarding experience to enter a completely new field, where people come
from a very different background - in my opinion this intentional &amp;ldquo;push&amp;rdquo; out of
the comfort zone really has a tendency to spark &lt;del&gt;great&lt;/del&gt; exciting ideas,
however uncofortable it feels at first.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Publication | Spatial Single Cell Mapping</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Delighted to say that our manuscript &amp;ldquo;&lt;em&gt;Single-cell and spatial transcriptomics
enables probabilistic inference of cell type topography&lt;/em&gt;&amp;rdquo; is now published in
&lt;em&gt;Communications Biology&lt;/em&gt; and thus out there for everyone to read in its final
form. This is the paper that describes the theoretical underpinnings for
&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/almaan/stereoscope&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;stereoscope&lt;/a&gt;, which allows you to
spatial map cell types found in single cell data onto spatial transcriptomics
data. There is also a nice bit of discussion as to whether spatial
transcriptomics data (ST/Visium) can be properly modeled using a negative
binomial distribution (which we use) found in the supplementary (spoiler, it
seems like it). Have a look at it if you are interested!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Manuscript Link : &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.nature.com/articles/s42003-020-01247-y&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;HERE&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;stereoscope Link : &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/almaan/stereoscope&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;HERE&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;P.S: I&amp;rsquo;m also planning to update the code base in the future, providing an API for
&lt;code&gt;scanpy&lt;/code&gt;, but also add some features like subsampling and gene selection to the
standard modules; but that is for later.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Manuscript | Spatial Exploration of Her2 Breast Cancer</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;We&amp;rsquo;ve put out a new
&lt;a href=&#34;%22https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.14.200600v1.article-metrics%22&#34;&gt;manuscript&lt;/a&gt; on bioRxiv, where the expression landscape of HER2-positive
breast cancer tumors is studied from a spatial perspective. This study contains
several examples of how spatial data may be analyzed and what information beyond
the obvious - like the spatial distribution of a certain gene - that can be
mined from it. My hope is that anyone looking for ideas regarding how to analyze
their own spatial data find this useful and relevant, irregardles of their
interest in breast cancer. In the study we cluster spots by gene expression, but
also take this one step further, using the clusters to find &lt;i&gt;core
signatures&lt;/i&gt; of immune and tumor cell populations within our samples. We also
use &lt;i&gt;stereoscope&lt;/i&gt; to map single cell data down onto our tissue sections,
information which then is used to indentify potential TLS-sites as well as to
study patterns of cell type co-localization. All the scripts and a neat app for
visualization of the results can be found &lt;a href=&#34;%22https://github.com/almaan/her2st/%22&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Browsing through my daily feed, I stumbled upon
&lt;a href=&#34;%22https://github.com/prathyvsh/formal-systems-in-biology%22target=%22_blank%22&#34;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt;
neat resource which lists (and links to) fundamental ideas that have shaped the
field of systems biology. To me, many of these publications represent some of
the earliest attempts to reduce complex biological systems and processes into
something simpler, more comprehensible, by viewing them through the lense of
mathematics; truly groundbreaking efforts that paved the way for the current
trends of ML/AI in biology. I&amp;rsquo;d strongly recommend anyone with an interest in
the field to have a look at it; something that contains work from both Alan
Turing and John von Neumann can&amp;rsquo;t be anything but good!&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I recently compiled some exercises focusing on analysis of spatial data for a
course (hosted by SIB). The material spans from very basic analysis
(visualization and clustering) to inference of spatial cell type distributions
by integration of single cell and spatial data. If you are excited about spatial
transcriptomics and what type of analysis you can apply to this type of data,
check out the material
&lt;a href=&#34;href=%22https://github.com/fmicompbio/adv_scrnaseq_2020/tree/master/spatial%22&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;
. It&amp;rsquo;s all written using standard python libraries for maximal transparency,
allowing you to follow each and every step.&lt;/p&gt;
