<h4> Formal Systems in Biology - A resource </h4>

<body>
Browsing through my daily feed, I stumbled upon <a
href="https://github.com/prathyvsh/formal-systems-in-biology"target="_blank">this</a>
neat resource which lists (and links to) fundamental ideas that have shaped the
field of systems biology. To me, many of these publications represent some of
the earliest attempts to reduce complex biological systems and processes into
something simpler, more comprehensible, by viewing them through the lense of 
mathematics; truly groundbreaking efforts that paved the way for the current
trends of ML/AI in biology. I'd strongly recommend anyone with an interest in
the field to have a look at it; something that contains work from both
Alan Turing and John von Neumann can't be anything but good!
