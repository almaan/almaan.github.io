<h4> Formal Systems in Biology - A resource </h4>

Browsing thorugh my daily feed, I stumbled upon <a
href="https://github.com/prathyvsh/formal-systems-in-biology"target="_blank">this</a>
neat resource which lists (and links to) some of the fundamental works that has
been essential in forming the field of systems biology. To me, many of these
publications represent some of the earliest attempts to reduce complex
biological systems and processes into something simpler and more comprehensible,
by viewing them through the eye of a mathematician; truly groundbreaking
efforts. I'd strongly recommend anyone with an interest in the field to have a
look at it - I mean - something that contains work from both Alan Turing and
John von Neumann can't be anything but good!
