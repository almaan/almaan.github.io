<h4> Spatial Transcriptomics Data Analysis </h4>

I've compiled some exercises focusing on analysis of spatial data; spanning from very basic analysis (visualization and clustering) to the integration of single cell and spatial data. If you are excited about spatial transcriptomics analysis and what you can do with your data, check out the material <a href="https://github.com/fmicompbio/adv_scrnaseq_2020/tree/master/spatial"> here </a>. It's all written using standard python libraries, allowing you to get some insight into what's really going on behind the scenes!
