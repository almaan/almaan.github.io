<h4> Exercises | Spatial Transcriptomics Data Analysis </h4>

I recently compiled some exercises focusing on analysis of spatial data for a
course (hosted by SIB). The material spans from very basic analysis
(visualization and clustering) to inference of spatial cell type distributions
by integration of single cell and spatial data. If you are excited about spatial
transcriptomics and what type of analysis you can apply to this type of data, check out
the material <a
href="https://github.com/fmicompbio/adv_scrnaseq_2020/tree/master/spatial"> here
</a>. It's all written using standard python libraries for maximal transparency,
allowing you to follow each and every step.
