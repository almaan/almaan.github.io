      <description>For this bi-weekly paper review, my choice fell upon a paper that I&amp;rsquo;ve skimmed through multiple times before, but never gave the proper read-through it deserves. It was a definite given when I started to curate a list of papers that I wanted to include in this series of reviews. Not only do I find it to be an elegant and well-composed paper, but it has had nothing but an /imperative/ influence on the RNA-seq based analysis these last years.</description>
