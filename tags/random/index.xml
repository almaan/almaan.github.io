      <description>&amp;#x1f44b; Introduction At 5:00 a.m. PT on June 28th, 2025, 369 lucky runners will start the Western States 100, one of American ultrarunning’s most iconic races. The 100.2-mile (161 km) course winds from Olympic Valley, near Palisades Tahoe, to a high school track in Auburn, California.&#xA;The race has made legends — and broken hearts. Entry comes via a lottery system or a coveted “Golden Ticket” that has to be won from fiercely competitive qualifiers.</description>

      <description>Imagine that you really want to go camping in any of the more popular National Parks here in the US, but there&amp;rsquo;s fierce competition to get the spots, what do you do to get an edge? You obviously write a bot to beat the other people to it.</description>
