      <description>Every person has their own style of traveling reflecting their interests, prioritize, budget, and physical abilities/limitations. I&amp;rsquo;ve had the privilege to travel quite a lot during the last five years, usually by extending work trips by a few days but sometimes just for pure pleasure. Most of these trips have been solo but there are a few exceptions. When traveling with others, I tend to adapt to their preferences, but when alone I have a fairly particular way of operating: I tend to cover a lot of ground in a small amount of time and also manage to keep the budget fairly low.</description>

      <description>Imagine that you really want to go camping in any of the more popular National Parks here in the US, but there&amp;rsquo;s fierce competition to get the spots, what do you do to get an edge? You obviously write a bot to beat the other people to it.</description>
