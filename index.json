Guilt for being so caught up in my own projects and activities that I\u0026rsquo;ve come to neglect one of the most essential duties as a researcher: to survey, read, and contemplate upon new (and old) material that have been published. It\u0026rsquo;s so easy to put that interesting paper aside in order to finish a project deadline, as no immediate gains are observed from reading through the former in contrast to completing the latter. Once a habit, this behavior efficiently imprints the idea that \u0026ldquo;making\u0026rdquo; is more important than learning; this might give a false sense of efficiency at first, but (I believe) has a severe negative impact on the quality and creativity of one\u0026rsquo;s work in the long run. How am one supposed to grow and expand the knowledge sphere if one never travels beyond its borders? Hence, I\u0026rsquo;ve somehow managed to conjure a vision of myself being a more active reader gatherer of information this year by committing to the task of doing bi-weekly paper reviews, starting today. I should say here, that these reviews will mainly be focused on summarizing the material presented, rather than evaluating them; but of course, if I have opinions or comments which I deem relevant, these will be shared as well. My hope is to continue this at least throughout the year, to then evaluate and reassess whether its an endeavor worth continuing. Alas, let\u0026rsquo;s get started.\n Paper Title : Toward a Common Coordinate Framework for the Human Body\nAuthors : Jennifer E. Rood, Tim Stuart, Shila Ghazanfar, Tommaso Biancalani, Eyal Fisher, Andrew Butler, Anna Hupalowska, Leslie Gaffney, William Mauck, Gökçen Eraslan, John C. Marioni, Aviv Regev, Rahul Satija\nPublished : 12-12-2019\ndoi : https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2019.11.019\nReview: In ambitious projects like the Human Cell Atlas we often rely on joint efforts from multiple labs, as well as collection of data across multiple individuals, ages, phenotypes, both sexes and plenty of other features. This strategy is very apt for producing large and diverse datasets; but unless we somehow harmonize and integrate all of the data into a common framework it will be nothing more than a big mess that is ought to bring more headaches than joy. The authors of this paper discuss these issues in terms of a common coordinate framework which they - very neatly - define as a reference map that can : \u0026ldquo;[..] assign a reproducible address to every location\u0026rdquo;. CCFs can be constructed at different scales (macro, meso, micro and fine are used as examples here), but its purpose always remains the same, to relate regions in independent samples in a shared context.\nPersonally, I think it\u0026rsquo;s easiest to motivate the need of a CCF through an analogy. Imagine you have a set of portraits, painted by different artists. Some paintings depict the same individual, but not all of them. An example of this scenario is illustrated below:\nNow, if we wanted to assess how skilled each painter was at recreating certain facial features (e.g., eyes or noses), we must somehow identify these different parts in each of the pictures before we could speak of comparing them. However, it\u0026rsquo;s insufficient to only compare the images pixel-by-pixel as we have several different motifs. Somehow, we need to use the common features of a face, to identify the unique elements of each artist. Similarly, when building an atlas of the human body, organs or sub-region of an organ using data from multiple sources, we need to know where each piece fits into the larger picture. A CCF would further enable a very precise exploration of variation across individuals, and is obviously a fundamental tool in any quest to study heterogeneity.\nIn the paper they discuss some of the challenges associated with the creation of a CCF, and consider the inherent anatomical diversity across individuals as perhaps the most prominent one. They also bring up a good point about how consistent annotation (used to assemble the CCF) is not as straightforward of a task as it might seem, since biological compartments and structures do not always have well-defined boundaries. Another challenge in devising methods to construct CCFs arise from the fact that a sample\u0026rsquo;s character by and large dictates how appropriate a certain method is. To illustrate this, two extremes are given as examples: (1) when anatomical regions are highly similar across all samples (e.g., early stages of embryogenesis), and (2) when cells are (seemingly) randomly organized (for example in a tumor). Of course, these two extremes represent end-points on a continuum, and most samples place somewhere in-between the two. For samples more like (1) leveraging the consistency and a priori knowledge is preferable, while for samples like (2) one would instead do better by employing data-driven methods where the locations are learnt from the data. Of course, in both scenarios it is appealing to envision a form of Bayesian approach, where we update our beliefs regarding a sample\u0026rsquo;s location as more data is gathered.\nDifferent variants of CCFs exist, three broad classes are given in the paper: using Anatomical Plane Coordinates, Landmark based construction and complex non-standard approaches. The first (anatomical plane coordinates) more or less aligns samples by registration to a reference (to account for inter-specimen variation). It uses a standard coordinate axis as the reference point to which distances are measured. One huge benefit is that distances between objects in this space, represent true distances. The landmark based approach is more or less an extension of the anatomical plane coordinates, but where one uses known landmarks (e.g., a vein bifurcation or a certain axon bundle) rather than anatomical planes. These landmarks allow one to anchor points in different samples to a reference. Having identified the landmarks, one may then apply a linear transformation to map a query image to the reference. For both the aforementioned strategies, the use of a reference is essential - the template itself may however be updated iteratively as the process progress. The complex non-standard approaches are used when there\u0026rsquo;s a lack of anatomical structure or when no clear landmarks can be identified. In complex approaches, local non-linear (in contrast to the other methods) warping is applied to account for large anatomical variation.\nNow of course, as you might have noted, both of the two first methods relies on a reference template. Hence the question of how such a template is obtained, to which the authors answers that it depends largely on the sample. For highly stereotypical samples, a successful approach has been to use an iterative process, starting with a seeding set to which the whole dataset is aligned, a new reference is then extracted and used as a seed in the next iteration; a procedure repeated until convergence. To overcome the inter-individual variability in samples with \u0026ldquo;similar inter-individual organ structure but differences in cell type location and organ dimensions\u0026rdquo; a certain degree of supervision was added to the procedure; by manual annotation of landmarks etc. Semi-supervised processes are also predicted to be of great use in the construction of a human atlas. For highly non-stereotypical samples, there were no good strategies for template construction at the date of their writing, and they mention how this will have to be remedied by new methodological developments.\nInterestingly the authors highlight a fourth orthogonal, and fairly unconventional, approach that discards the use of a pre-defined coordinate system, landmarks and templates, in favor of learning it from the data itself. Multiple examples of methods for spatial reconstruction (see Seurat v3 and novoSpaRc) can be seen as testimonies to spatial information being contained within the expression profiles of cells. To me, this is very similar to the SLAM problem in robot localization, where one tries to create the map while also finding ones current position within it.\nThey also discuss how, once a CCF is established, samples of the same and different modalities may be mapped to it. If we are operating with data of the same modality, the process should be nothing but straightforward. We simply use the same strategy as when creating the CCF itself. For other cross-modality-mapping the case is slightly different, and integration will only be possible if the assumption that both modalities shares a latent representation (e.g., chromatin accessibility) holds.\nNow, one idea that the authors introduce, and which according to them is novel (I can find nothing that would contradict the claim) is that given all these challenges and how much influence a sample\u0026rsquo;s character has on the choice of method, is to dismiss the objective of creating a single CCF. Instead, multiple CCFs should be created in a hierarchical (by scale) fashion, which would allow both horizontal and vertical movements across the atlas, but where each CCF is adapted to best fit the data. This would represent a sort of \u0026ldquo;atlas of atlases\u0026rdquo; as they express it. To me, this makes perfect sense, although it would have been interesting to see some more discussion of how the vertical movements (between scales) were envisioned.\nTheir conclusions are brief, and so shall mine be. They make a strong argument for the value of CCFs, and why they deserve our attention. Inter-individual variability is the biggest hurdle to tackle, but there are strategies for it, though highly dependent on the data; this is not a \u0026ldquo;one-size fits all\u0026rdquo; type of problem. When the data is complex and we can\u0026rsquo;t establish natural anatomical templates or find good landmarks, perhaps it\u0026rsquo;s better to let the data dictate its own reference, using approaches inspired from methods of spatial reconstruction. All in all, CCFs brings structure to a very chaotic and seemingly unstructured space - and they are imperative to the process of creating a unified atlas of the human body.\n","date":1611064897,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1611064897,"objectID":"38dba622c205a2a69ebb198c9cc0e503","permalink":"/post/2021-01-19-ccf-rev/","publishdate":"2021-01-19T15:01:37+01:00","relpermalink":"/post/2021-01-19-ccf-rev/","section":"post","summary":"For quite some while now, I\u0026rsquo;ve carried a slight sensation of guilt within me.

It is the first time that ST (Spatial Transcriptomics) has been applied to the mouse liver, and aims to show how the technique enables the liver to be explored from new, different and illuminating perspective. A lot of standard analysis, such as clustering and identification of differential genes (DEGs) are presented in the paper and show affirmative results, attesting to the (experimental) method\u0026rsquo;s ability to delineate regions with various expression profiles (often overlapping well with morphological structures).\nMy contribution to this paper was nevertheless slightly different and consisted mainly of two parts:\n Construction of a framework to model feature signals as a function of the distance to a given object. Development of a classifier to predict vein type (a binary classification task) based on the expression profiles surrounding a certain genes.  Both concepts are excellent examples of analyses that are exclusive to spatial data, i.e., similar information cannot be obtained from single cell experiments; something I\u0026rsquo;m keen to highlight, as it is often the case that one fails to make proper use of the \u0026ldquo;spatial\u0026rdquo; part in spatial transcriptomics data, and rather treat it as single cell data, to then visualize the results spatially. Both implementations are very simple, but I have not seen similar analyses in ST or Visium data yet, of course that could be due to me not having surveyed the field thoroughly enough, but still. Allow me to elaborate some on these two concepts below.\nFeature by distance In the liver tissue one can broadly classify vein structures as either portal or central based on their position and connections. Previous studies have shown that these structures are associated with slightly different expression profiles, as different celltypes (periportal respective pericentral hepatocytes) are present in them.\nWhat we did in this study was to first \u0026ldquo;measure\u0026rdquo; the distance of each spot (spatial capture location) to the nearest vein (of respective type), and then for each gene create a set of distance-expression tuples that could be visualized in a scatter plot. While these values are discrete, once a curve smooting techniques is applied we can easily think of the resulting curve as a function that maps distance to gene expression. By doing so one could really see how the associated marker genes (to each vein) had a high expression near their respective vein, and how this decreased as distance increased (inverse relationship). You can see some examples of these trends in the plots below, top row displays portal vein marker genes, bottom central:\nClassification of vein types by expression Now, while pathologists and experts in the field usually are able to annotate each vein type by visual inspection (this is how we obtained the annotations used for the feature by distance plots), there are sometimes ambiguities and limited access to such individuals. However, the expression profiles of portal and central veins should be the similar for all veins of the same type, independent of whether identity is easy to deduce from morphology or not. Hence, by creating neighborhood expression profiles (NEPs) surrounding each vein, and training a classifier (actually logistic regression) using NEPs from veins with known identities; we were able to predict vein type of ambiguous veins. During cross-validation (leave one sample out) the model also performed very well with higher than 80% accuracy.\nTo read more about the study, check out the manuscript here, and the Python package we released (hepaquery) to perform similar analyses with any type of spatial transcriptomics data at the github page.\nI\u0026rsquo;m very happy to have worked with a nice team with complementary biology and computational skills, this really resulted in a neat manuscript; also a big kudos to the first author Franziska, who pushed very hard in the end to finalize this project.\n","date":1610449159,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1610449159,"objectID":"fd7e03d9d0f710dfa8d11e7f9a57ef2d","permalink":"/post/2021-01-12-liver-biorxiv/","publishdate":"2021-01-12T11:59:19+01:00","relpermalink":"/post/2021-01-12-liver-biorxiv/","section":"post","summary":"I\u0026rsquo;m thrilled to announce that a collaboration with my good friend and colleague, Franziska Hildebrandt, now has matured to the state of being ready for journal submission, which also coincides with a pre-print upload to bioRxiv.","tags":[],"title":"Manuscript | Spatial Transcriptomics to define transcriptional patterns of zonation and structural components in the liver","type":"post"},{"authors":["Alma Anderson"],"categories":[],"content":"I\u0026rsquo;ve always found it appealing, or rather enticing, to study biological systems from a more formal and mathematical perspective; with the main objective to somehow be able to describe them with equations rather than words. Equations are exact, definite, universal, but foremost, they are predictive. The alluring property of mathematical models is that they do not only provide a description of our system, but they are also responsive, we may ask \u0026ldquo;if I replace parameter X with parameter Y, what will my system look like?\u0026quot;.\nOf course, our models - however beautiful or carefully constructed - are nothing but just that, models. And as the well known apohorism states, \u0026ldquo;all models are wrong\u0026rdquo;. While this statement is true, it is far from detrimental. Sometimes, being wrong but within a certain marginal of error to the truth is just about good enough. When driving, none of us knows the exact distance to the other cars, or how much a push on the gas will accelerate our car, still (most of the time) we manage to zig-zag through the densely packed lanes without crashing into each other - all from the simple incorrect model we constructed in our minds. So, yes - models are wrong, but they are most certainly useful and tremendously valuable in our quest to understand and analyze biological systems.\nIt was with this interest - and a requirement for PhD students at KTH to collect 60 ECTS credits - that I enrolled for a course in Applied Estimation. In short, the course focus on how to estimate states or parameters from noisy measurements such as empirical data. Albeit designed for people working with robotics, the concepts are indubitably applicable to biology - where noise is the rule rather than the exception.\nAs a part of the course, we had to devise our own project (where one estimation method was to used) and implement it in code. My choice fell upon a subject (and method) that I have little previous experience with: automated cell tracking in brightfield images, using GM-PHD (Gaussian Mixture Probability Hypothesis Density) filters. The theory is very interesting, and I was particularly intrigued by the concept of Random Finite Sets, here used to track multiple objects simultaneously. The method shares many similarities with the Kalman Filter, but rather than propagating a single state, the whole set is propagated in time. Easily explained, one might think of it as propagating a Gaussian Mixture in time, where each component represents a peak or cell. The original publication by Vo and Ma outlines the details of the GM-PHD filter better than I could ever attempt to, and I would refer anyone with an interest to have a close look at it.\nAs for the final product, I implemented the algorithm proposed by Vo and Ma (Table I-III) in python, with an easy to use CLI; allowing anyone who might want to try it out to do so fairly (I hope) seamlessly. Instructions and examples of usage can be found at the github page. The animated image above is the result of applying this implementation to a set of \u0026ldquo;HeLa cells stably expressing H2b-GFP\u0026rdquo;, downloaded from celltrackingchallenge.net. The implementation is far from perfect, and much work remains to even have a chance of competing with the more sophisticated alternatives. Still, for a couple of days of work, the performance is not too bad - and it was a fun experience implementing it.\nThe course has prompted a lot of new ideas and really allowed me to see some old problems from a completely different lens. For example, I believe a lot of the ideas found in SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping) could be used when working with questions related to trajectory inferenc, where we partly want to assess the developmental landscape but also map a path through it. It\u0026rsquo;s always a very rewarding experience to enter a completely new field, where people come from a very different background - in my opinion this intentional \u0026ldquo;push\u0026rdquo; out of the comfort zone really has a tendency to spark great exciting ideas, however uncofortable it feels at first.\n","date":1610097951,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1610097951,"objectID":"bd2c4610723e1a9d61a3ef3498fcc267","permalink":"/post/2021-01-08-celltracker/","publishdate":"2021-01-08T10:25:51+01:00","relpermalink":"/post/2021-01-08-celltracker/","section":"post","summary":"I\u0026rsquo;ve always found it appealing, or rather enticing, to study biological systems from a more formal and mathematical perspective; with the main objective to somehow be able to describe them with equations rather than words.","tags":[],"title":"Models and automated cell tracking","type":"post"},{"authors":[],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1605884100,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1605884100,"objectID":"5ccf3a9fac565207aef25af7914f7876","permalink":"/talk/2020-11-20-ugm/","publishdate":"2020-11-20T16:25:00+01:00","relpermalink":"/talk/2020-11-20-ugm/","section":"talk","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"Exploring the cell type topography by integration of spatial and single cell data","type":"talk"},{"authors":[],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1603359000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1603359000,"objectID":"ff44752e2eefe605bb3d2e05721fef75","permalink":"/talk/2020-10-22-10xrs/","publishdate":"2020-10-22T11:00:00+01:00","relpermalink":"/talk/2020-10-22-10xrs/","section":"talk","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"Exploring the cell type topography by integration of spatial and single cell data","type":"talk"},{"authors":["Alma Anderson"],"categories":[],"content":"Delighted to say that our manuscript \u0026ldquo;Single-cell and spatial transcriptomics enables probabilistic inference of cell type topography\u0026rdquo; is now published in Communications Biology and thus out there for everyone to read in its final form.
