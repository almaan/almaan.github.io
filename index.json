This is the paper that describes the theoretical underpinnings for stereoscope, which allows you to spatial map cell types found in single cell data onto spatial transcriptomics data. There is also a nice bit of discussion as to whether spatial transcriptomics data (ST/Visium) can be properly modeled using a negative binomial distribution (which we use) found in the supplementary (spoiler, it seems like it).

My hope is that anyone looking for ideas regarding how to analyze their own spatial data find this useful and relevant, irregardles of their interest in breast cancer. In the study we cluster spots by gene expression, but also take this one step further, using the clusters to find core signatures of immune and tumor cell populations within our samples. We also use stereoscope to map single cell data down onto our tissue sections, information which then is used to indentify potential TLS-sites as well as to study patterns of cell type co-localization.
