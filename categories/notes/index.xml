      <description>&amp;#x1f44b; Introduction I usually write about my own &amp;ldquo;projects&amp;rdquo; or ideas here, but this time I wanted to do something a bit more educational. Lately, I’ve been working on models that incorporate — or entirely rely on — the idea of Flow Matching, and I’ve grown to really enjoy this class of models. So I figured I’d write a short and (hopefully 🤞) approachable overview of how they work.&#xA;We’ll keep things simple and structure it as follows:</description>

      <description>&amp;#x1f44b; Introduction At 5:00 a.m. PT on June 28th, 2025, 369 lucky runners will start the Western States 100, one of American ultrarunning’s most iconic races. The 100.2-mile (161 km) course winds from Olympic Valley, near Palisades Tahoe, to a high school track in Auburn, California.&#xA;The race has made legends — and broken hearts. Entry comes via a lottery system or a coveted “Golden Ticket” that has to be won from fiercely competitive qualifiers.</description>

      <description>Three to four mornings a week, I walk to one of the Genentech shuttle buses, hop on, fall asleep, and wake up slightly disoriented as we arrive on campus. On the other days, I bike or run to work. To some extent this walk is a part of my routine, and when something becomes part of my routine I want to optimize it.&#xA;In this case optimization means that I want to find the time by which I should leave from home that:</description>

      <description>Every person has their own style of traveling reflecting their interests, prioritize, budget, and physical abilities/limitations. I&amp;rsquo;ve had the privilege to travel quite a lot during the last five years, usually by extending work trips by a few days but sometimes just for pure pleasure. Most of these trips have been solo but there are a few exceptions. When traveling with others, I tend to adapt to their preferences, but when alone I have a fairly particular way of operating: I tend to cover a lot of ground in a small amount of time and also manage to keep the budget fairly low.</description>
